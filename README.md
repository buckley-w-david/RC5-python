# python-cryto

Originally this repository was for an assignment in my Computer Security course at the Univeristy of Guelph.

In the interest of public good since I occasionally notice people stumbling across this repo, I've since refactored it so it's a least not quite so bad as it was when originally implimented.

# Usage

[Poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) is a pretty great dependency management and packaging tool, I use it. If you want to use this for some reason, I suggest checking it out. Once you have it up just run `poetry dev` and it'll be setup and ready.

The package has an incredibly basic CLI, that will be accessable once you've installed the package. It is called `crypto`.  
Run `crypto --help` for usage instructions.
